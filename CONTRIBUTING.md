# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions to make this list better! Please follow these rules:

1. **Search first** – Check if your suggestion already exists to avoid duplicates.  
2. **Link format** – Add entries like this:  
   ```markdown
   * [project-name](http://example.com) - A short description that ends with a dot. **Python**.
3. Link domain only – Use the root domain (e.g., http://example.com) instead of deep links that may expire.
4. Programming language – Add the main language of the software in bold (e.g., Python, C++).
5. Proprietary resources – Mark clearly if the resource is not freely available.
6. Quality check – Ensure correct spelling, grammar, and remove trailing whitespace.
7. Pull Request – Submit your contribution via a Pull Request. Add a short note in the PR explaining why the project/resource/tool is awesome.
